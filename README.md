# ImageProcessing
A few filter for image:
1. Trim the image (choose a length and this method will return a new trimmed image of that length of all 4 sizes)
2. Negative Color version of the image
3. Stretch Horizontally the image (double its length)
4. Shrink the image Vertically (halve its height)
5. Invert an image
6. Change the color tone of the image (RGB)

How it works: You put in the image, the code turns the image into a 2D array of pixels, then process with the filter, then turn back from the 2D array to the new image for you. Neat heh ?

/img folder contains a few images if you want to try out !
